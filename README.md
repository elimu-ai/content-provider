## Utils Library 📦

The Content Provider comes with a [`utils`](utils) library (`.aar`) which makes it easier for other Android apps to fetch content from the Content Provider.

Here is how to use the `utils` library in another Android app:

  1. Add repository:
  
    allprojects {
        repositories {
            ...
            maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        }
    }
  
  2. Add dependency:
  
    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.elimu-ai:content-provider:<version>@aar'
    }

See https://jitpack.io/#elimu-ai/content-provider/ for the latest version available.

### Usage Example

For an example of another Android app using the `utils` library, see the Vitabu app's Gradle configuration:

  1. https://github.com/elimu-ai/vitabu/blob/main/build.gradle
  1. https://github.com/elimu-ai/vitabu/blob/main/app/build.gradle

## Development 👩🏽‍💻

During development, you can choose between 3 build types:
1. `debug`
2. `qa_test`
3. `release`

By default, both `debug` and `qa_test` are pointing to a webapp 
[test server](https://github.com/elimu-ai/webapp/blob/main/INSTALL.md#test-server). And if you want 
to  run the webapp yourself on `localhost` while testing the Content Provider app, you can change 
the return value of the `getBaseUrl` method in 
[BaseApplication.java](app/src/main/java/ai/elimu/content_provider/BaseApplication.java):
```java
//        return url;
        return "http://192.168.xxx.xxx:8080/webapp";
```

Use the `ifconfig` or `ipconfig` to get your IPv4 address.

You will also have to enable http connections by adding the following file to 
`app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
        <trust-anchors>
            <certificates src="system" />
        </trust-anchors>
    </base-config>
</network-security-config>
```

And then adding it to [AndroidManifest.xml](app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml):
```xml
<application
        android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"
```

After that, connect your Android device to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer, and run the app.

## Release 📦

To perform a release, follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch for the release
1. Remove `-SNAPSHOT`
  - from the `versionName` in `app/build.gradle`
  - from the `versionName` in `utils/build.gradle`
  - from the `version` in `utils/build.gradle`
1. Click "Draft a new release" at https://github.com/elimu-ai/content-provider/releases
1. Pick the new branch you created as the target branch
1. Create a new tag (e.g. `1.2.19`)
1. Choose a release title, and click "Publish release"
1. Ensure that the release appears at https://jitpack.io/#elimu-ai/content-provider with "Status: ok"
1. Prepare for next development iteration by bumping the version and adding `-SNAPSHOT`
  - in the `versionCode` in `app/build.gradle`
  - in the `versionName` in `app/build.gradle`
  - in the `versionCode` in `utils/build.gradle`
  - in the `versionName` in `utils/build.gradle`
  - in the `version` under `publishing` in `utils/build.gradle`
1. Commit the changes
1. Create a pull request for merging your branch into `main`
